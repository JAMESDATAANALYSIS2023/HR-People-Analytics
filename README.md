# HR Analytics – Synthetic Data Project

This project showcases how HR (People) Analytics can be applied to real business questions using **synthetic HR data** created in R. It demonstrates data generation, cleaning, exploration, and predictive modeling techniques commonly used by HR analytics teams and consultants.

## 📊 Project Overview

Organizations often need to answer questions such as:
- Are new hires being paid fairly compared to peers?
- What drives employee engagement?
- Which recruiting sources bring high-performing, long-tenured employees?
- Where are safety incidents happening, and how can we reduce risk?
- Can we predict employee churn to take early action?

This project simulates an HR dataset and shows how to analyze it end-to-end, combining descriptive and predictive analytics.
