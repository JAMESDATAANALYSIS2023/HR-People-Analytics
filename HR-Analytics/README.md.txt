# HR Analytics – Workforce Insights in R

This folder contains a complete HR analytics project using a **synthetic HR dataset**.

### What’s inside
- **`data_generation.qmd`** – creates a synthetic HR dataset (optional if already generated).
- **`hr_analytics.qmd`** – explores recruiting source effectiveness, engagement, and attrition.
- Uses the dataset stored in the repo’s `Data/` folder.

### Key Features
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with tidyverse.
- Statistical testing: Chi-Square, t-test, ANOVA.
- Logistic regression to model attrition likelihood.
- Dynamic detection of the department with the highest disengagement.

### How to run
Open either `.qmd` in RStudio and click **Render** to generate the HTML report.

Synthetic data ensures this project is safe to share publicly.
